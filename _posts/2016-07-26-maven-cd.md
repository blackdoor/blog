title: Complete guide to continuous deployment to maven central from Travis CI
author: nathan

Continuous deployment is a very useful tool for open source projects. The people accepting pull requests in an open source project may not all have the permissions or skills to also deploy those changes, but continuous deployment offers them a way around that. Once code is accepted into the master branch, that code is deployed automatically. This allows individuals deploying pull requests to add agile features and make bug fixes without taking up too much time.

This guide will take your maven library project from creation and local installation to creation and code-signing in the cloud, where it is then deployed to maven central. We make a few assumptions about your starting point:

* Your project already is a valid maven project (if it's not, see [here](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html))
* Your project is hosted on github (if not, [create a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/))
* You are using Linux, OSX or other *nix system with bash
* You have gpg installed and available on the path
* You have the travis command line client installed ([`gem install travis`](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#readme))

# Obtain OSSRH account

OSSRH is a free host for open source projects in maven central. If you do not already have an account, follow the [instructions for initial setup](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html#initial-setup) and ensure you get a confirmation email. You should use a domain you own for the group id, such as `com.mysite`. If you do not have a domain, it is also popular to use your github domain, such as `io.github.username`.

## Configure maven project for upload to OSSRH
Before we can start to consider uploading, we need to ensure our project has all the information it needs to be a quality library. We need to fill out the following fields in our pom.xml:

* `name` - the name of the project
* `description` - a short description
* `url` - location where users can go to get more information about the library
* `licences` - self explanatory
* `scm` - source control information
* `developers` - who worked on the project

Once complete, these might look like this:

```xml
<name>my library</name>
<description>A library.</description>
<url>https://username.github.io/project</url>

    <license>

    <connection>scm:git:git://github.com/username/project.git</connection>
    <developerConnection>scm:git:git@github.com:username/project.git</developerConnection>
</scm>
    
<developers>
    <developer>
        <id>username</id>
        <name>John Doe</name>
        <email>jdoe@email.com</email>
    </developer>
</developers>
```
