# And it's pissing me off.

Okay, so I was just looking at the code highlighting on Jacob's last post. Here it is:

```c
int i;
int j = 0;
for(i = 0; i < j; ++i)
{
	    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

Now, if you're an actual sane person, you should immediately see something about this
which turns your stomach. Yes that's right, that for-loop indentation is **8 fucking spaces**.

Seriously. I couldn't believe it either. This is why I hate tabs. A tab could be 8 spaces on one
system, 4 spaces on another, 5 on another, etc. etc. It's bad practice and it just plain
grinds my gear. Look how nice the same block of code looks with a sane 4 space indent:

```c
int i;
int j = 0;
for(i = 0; i < j; ++i)
{
	printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

How nice is that?

# In conclusion
Use spaces or set your tabs to auto-indent 4 spaces you philistines.
