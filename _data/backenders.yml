  bio : has begun to exhibit signs of Operaturievunism, or what is colloquially known as
  "Young Computer Professional in a Tech Hub Syndrome". He has begun to use Ubuntu linux
  extensively, has begun maintaining a minimalist tech-related website with hints of technical
  puns, and has expressed interest in the sport of Cycling. 
  We recommend immediate injections of H453HCD vaccine, known by most as "reality" to prevent further degradation

- name: Trent "spacekek" Clostio
  bio : Experiencing personality changes due to the trial drug "internet". His  
  misanthropic nature has taken a firmer hold; he has relegated most of his primary 
  empathetic emotions for those associated to amusement and general schadenfreude. 
  We'll need to observe much closer in the coming years to recommend treatment, but for 
  now it seems the only solution is to up the dose of the trial drug as he is slowly becoming immune.

- name: Jacob "yacklebeam" Troxel
  bio : 
Subject alias YackleTroxJacobBeam6969 (old convention to maintain anonymity), a member of the 
early trials to the drug has undergone irreversible changes to his psyche. Time spent streaming, 
and watching streams while on "internet" (likely strain 2010-15) has rendered his mental facilities 
almost entirely void. As a self-proclaimed "gamer", slang for unemployable, he has delusions that 
games have meaning and should be regarded as art - such as his favorite game LoL. He spends most of 
his time regurgitating tired "may may" to other members of his tribe, and blithering about nonsense in his room alone.
